I currently have a bachelor's degree that I obtained in 2021. At the beginning of this year of 2021, in parallel of my studies, I started the web development and it is at this moment that I found my way. I decided to train in web development. Now coding is my passion, learning it was something that I wanted to do. It was me choosing to educate my self about something I really cared about. That was a trigger for me in life and that was the moment I fell in love with coding but most importantly with learning.",
