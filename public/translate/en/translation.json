Today I master and have a good experience of front end basics (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and React. Currently I code mainly using React, Redux and Styled Components. I also have some back end experience with NodeJS. Today coding being my passion, learning it was something I wanted to do. I chose to educate myself on something that really interested me. This was a trigger for me in life and that's when I fell in love with coding, but more importantly learning.",
